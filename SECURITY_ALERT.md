# 🚨 URGENT: AWS Credentials Compromised - Immediate Action Required

## ⚠️ Security Breach Detected
Your AWS credentials have been exposed in a chat/conversation. This is a **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**.

### 🔥 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do this NOW):

#### 1. **Disable Compromised Credentials (URGENT)**
```bash
# Login to AWS Console immediately
# Go to IAM → Users → ytube → Security credentials
# Find Access Key: AKIA6LPCS4S4GSWJ2EMX
# Click "Make inactive" or "Delete"
```

#### 2. **Create New Access Keys**
```bash
# In AWS Console: IAM → Users → ytube → Security credentials
# Click "Create access key"
# Download the new credentials
# Never share these publicly again
```

#### 3. **Update Your Environment**
```bash
# Update your local AWS configuration
aws configure

# Or update environment variables
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-new-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-new-secret-key
```

#### 4. **Check for Unauthorized Usage**
```bash
# Check CloudTrail logs for suspicious activity
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=Username,AttributeValue=ytube --start-time 2025-08-01

# Check current resources
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws ec2 describe-instances
aws s3 ls
aws rds describe-db-instances
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Going Forward

### ✅ DO:
- Store credentials in environment variables or AWS credentials file
- Use IAM roles when possible (for EC2, Lambda, etc.)
- Rotate access keys regularly (every 90 days)
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for application secrets
- Enable MFA on your AWS account

### ❌ DON'T:
- Share credentials in chat, code, or public forums
- Commit credentials to version control
- Use root account credentials for applications
- Share screenshots containing credentials

## 🛠️ Secure Credential Management for Bstream

### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)
```bash
# .env.local (never commit this file)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-new-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-new-secret-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Option 2: AWS Credentials File
```bash
# ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your-new-access-key
aws_secret_access_key = your-new-secret-key
region = us-east-1
```

### Option 3: IAM Roles (Production)
For production deployment, use IAM roles instead of access keys:
- EC2 Instance Roles
- ECS Task Roles  
- Lambda Execution Roles

## 📊 Your Account Status Check

Run these commands to verify your account security:

```bash
# Check who you are
aws sts get-caller-identity

# List all access keys for your user
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name ytube

# Check recent API calls (requires CloudTrail)
aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix CloudTrail
```

## 🎯 Next Steps for Bstream Deployment

Once you've secured your credentials:

1. **Update credentials** in your deployment scripts
2. **Run security scan**: `npm run test:aws`
3. **Deploy with new credentials**: `npm run aws:deploy`
4. **Monitor for suspicious activity**

## 📞 AWS Support

If you see unauthorized charges or suspicious activity:
- Contact AWS Support immediately
- File a security incident report
- Consider enabling AWS Config for compliance monitoring

**🚨 REMEMBER: Fix the credentials issue FIRST before proceeding with any deployment!**
